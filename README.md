Module 11 Challenge

Used Firefox instead of Google Chrome. I started all of my excercises in class with it and just stayed with it. I felt it would have been more confusing to me to swtich back

for my code to work if you run it you will need to download "geckdriver" and path it. Otherwise it will not work Just a heads up

- Part 1 Mars News

-Part 2 Mars Weather scrape and analayze
https://github.com/terrycleek/webscrapping-challenge/blob/main/part_2_mars_weather.ipynb

Please reach out if there is an issue. I can try to get it switched back to chrome if its too big of a deal. I am sorry just not the biggest fan of chrome

Also just a heads up I made a note underneath in the analysis:

1.Which month, on average, has the lowest temperature? The highest? (10 points)
2.Which month, on average, has the lowest atmospheric pressure? The highest? (10 points)
3.How many terrestrial days exist in a Martian year? A visual estimate within 25% was made. (10 points)


This still is already answered in the starting code
